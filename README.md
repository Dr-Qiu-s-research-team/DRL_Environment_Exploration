## Introduction


Given a known environment, planning an obstcal-free

## Publications

The original paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning Model to generate a set of obstacle-free waypoints in a known environment.

The latest paper implements ADMM method to prune the DRL model and get a much smaller but better performence model.
